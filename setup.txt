We are creating a starter kit for developing markdown driver agents inside vscode with the following characteristics:
- include a reading list explaining the concepts of agents, agentic ai, mcp servers and usage, agent skills (as defined here https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
- create a step-by-step tutorial document for setting up a vscode environment based on the github repo this document is part of
- the tutorial needs to cover the following;
1. setup of the environment
2. explanation and basic setup of the github-instructions markdown file
3. creating the first markdown driven agent
4. adding mcp server connections into azure devops and azure portal
5. using an agent and the chat client to access data through the mcp server connections
6. for advanced users a guid towards building a first mcp server in either c# or python
